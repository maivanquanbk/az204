## Develop Azure compute solution (25-30%)

### Implement IaaS Solutions

***

#### Provision VMs

***

> Compile checklist for creating a VM:
>
> - Start with the network
> - Name the VM
> - Decide location of the VM
> - Decide size of the VM
> - Storage for the VM
> - Select an Operating system
> - Understand pricing model

1. Start with the network

    - It is important to plan before creating resources because it is hard to change latter.
    - If the VNet is to be connected to other VNets or on-premises networks, you must select address ranges that don't overlap.
    - Best practice to use unrouteable IP address: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16
    - Azure reserves the first four and the last IP in each subnet for its own use.
    - Security: By default, services outside VNets cannot access services inside VNets. However, services in different subnets of a VNets can talk to each other. We can use NSG to control the traffic flow to and from subnet; and to and from VMs.
    - A VM must have at least one NIC but can have more than one. Each NIC attached to a VM must exist in the same location and subscription of the VM.
    - Can change the subnet VM connected to but cannot change the VNet.

    **Terminologies**: Virtual network (VNets), Subnet, Network security group (NGS), Network Interface (NIC), Network address translation ([NAT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections)), Private & Public IP.

2. Plan for each VM

    **Checklist**:

    - What does the VM communication with?
    - Which ports are open?
    - Which OS is used?
    - How much disk space is in use?
    - What kind of data does this use? Are there any restrictions?
    - What sort of CPU, memory, and disk IO load does the VM need?

    **Name the VM**:

    - It’s not trivial to change later.
    - You should choose names that are meaningful and consistent which follow a sort of convention.

    **Decide location of the VM**:

    - Criteria:

        - Distance to users, legal, compliance requirements, etc. 
        - Each region has different hardware available, and some configurations are not available in all regions.
        - Prices could be different between locations.
    - Learn more about Azure paired regions: [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions#what-are-paired-regions)

    **Decide size of the VM**:

    Types:

    - General purpose: Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing & development. Suit for small to medium databases and small to medium traffic web servers.
    - Compute optimized: High CPU-to memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers.
    - Memory optimized: High memory-to-CPU. Great for relational database server, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics.
    - Storage optimized: High disk throughput and IO. Ideas for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL database, data warehousing and large transactional databases.
    - GPU: Optimized for graphic rendering, machine learning.
    - High performance compute: designed for HPC workloads.

    Be careful about resizing production VMs - they will be rebooted automatically which can cause a temporary outage and change some configuration settings such as the IP address.

    **Storage for the VM**:

    - All VM will have at least two virtual hard disks (VHDs). The first stores the operation system, and the second is used as temporary storage.
    - It’s common to create one or more data disks to manage the security, reliability, and performance of the disk independently.
    - Each VHD is held in Azure Storage as page blobs.
    - Two options for managing the relationship between the storage account and each VHD:

        - **Unmanaged disks**: We create and manage our own storage accounts that are used to hold the VHDs. A single storage account has a fixed-rate limit of 20,000 I/O operations/sec which supporting 40 VHDs at full utilization. We need create more storage accounts if we want to scale out.
        - **Managed disks**: ***Recommended model***. Azure will manage the storage accounts for us. We can specify the size of the disk up to 4 TB. We can easily scale-out without worrying about storage account limits.

    **Select the OS**:

    - Azure bundles the cost of the OS license into the price.
    - Scan Azure Marketplace to get the images for variety of stacks

    **Understand the pricing model**:

    - Compute and storage are charged independently
    - Compute expenses are billed on a per-minute basis when a VM is up. The cost includes OS license cost. Linux-based VMs are cheaper because there is no license charge.
    - Storage costs are billed even when a VM is stop or deallocated.
